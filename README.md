Problem Definition:
You have been engaged as a consultant by BestCard, a credit card company, to analyze a dataset they have provided. This dataset encompasses demographic and recent financial information for a sample of 30,000 of their account holders. The data is organized at the individual credit account level, ensuring each account is uniquely represented by a single row within the dataset. Each row is annotated to indicate whether the account owner defaulted in the subsequent month following a six-month historical data review period. Defaulting, in this context, means failing to meet the minimum payment requirement.

Goal:
Your primary objective is to construct a predictive model to accurately forecast the likelihood of an account defaulting in the next month.
The dataset you will be working with is a modified version of the dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For detailed information on the dataset, including the data dictionary, please refer to the following link: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset.
